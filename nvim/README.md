# Info
On the master branch is my current nvim configuration. On v2.0 is the nvchad configuration that I used to use before.

## Todo:
- [x] When scrolling too much right, and then coming back, the screen doesn't come back as quickly
- [x] Add null-ls for formatting
- [x] Choose a theme
- [x] Change the color of the autocomplete
- [x] Make comments work
- [x] Delete tab when navigating out if it's not saved in harpoon
- [x] Add git to signcolumn
- [x] gitsigns not working
- [x] change ctrl L to ctrl ; for copilot, because clashing with ctrl l for moving in insert mode
- [ ] change my default lsp to something else
- [ ] figure out how to use emmet snips and autocomplete for commonly used functions like `if __name__ == "__main__":` etc
